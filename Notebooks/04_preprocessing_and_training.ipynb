    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "The pipeline below defines exactly those same steps. Crucially, the resultant `Pipeline` object has a `fit()` method and a `predict()` method, just like the `LinearRegression()` object itself. Just as you might create a linear regression model and train it with `.fit()` and predict with `.predict()`, you can wrap the entire process of imputing and feature scaling and regression in a single object you can train with `.fit()` and predict with `.predict()`. And that's basically a pipeline: a model on steroids."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we’re looking to see if we can predict resort prices by creating a model that uses data on a variety of ‘features’ across resorts. We divided our data set into ‘training’ data and ‘testing’ data. We use the former for developing the model, and the latter for testing it (the model would look great if we only tested it on the training data). As a benchmark or reference point, we calculated the simple average resort price: $63.81. In doing so, we hope that our model will predict prices for each resort much closer to actuals than the average of the whole set. Otherwise, what was the point of the model?\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, when we calculated r^2 on the testing data using the mean from the training data, we got a negative value (i.e., the mean for the training data doesn’t account for the variance in the testing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the mean square error, on average we’d be off by $19 if we predicted prices just using the average. This is a considerable amount of the average ticket price, so there’s strong motivation for doing better than a simple average.\n",
    "\n",
    "After imputing missing values using median (and also the mean, which didn’t make much difference) values and scaling the data, we then built a linear regression model. We found that this model was able to explain 80% and 70% of the variance in the training and test data, respectively. Given the drop-off between these percentages, it seems that we overfitted to the training data - which is no surprise, given how many features we used in the model. We’ll likely want to use a smaller set of features in our model by the end, for the sake of providing simpler/actionable/more persuasive recommendations to the business. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of indefinitely tinkering with the number of features to include, we then shifted to a cross-validation approach. Using the GridSearch function, we found that the best # of features was 8 (this had the highest r^2 and the lowest variance). The resulting r^2 was about 68%. We found that the most positive features were vertical drop (exciting runs), area covered by snow making (guaranteed skiing), total chairs, fastQuads (both related to ease of getting around), and Runs. (Won’t rehash what the exercise already mentions as far as explanations any more.)\n",
    "\n",
    "After the linear regression, we tried a random forest modeling approach. We experimented with the number of trees, imputing with the mean and median, and feature scaling. Imputing with the median seemed to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four dominant features surfaced by the random forest approach were fastQuads, Runs, snow-making-covered area, and vertical drop. These overlap with what we found from the linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest model has a lower mean absolute error than the linear regression (by almost $1). It also exhibits less variability, so we go with this one!\n",
